# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot
This is the code written for an obstacle avoidance robot which I designed and created in my college robotics course. A full report describing the purpose, bill of materials, theory of operation, design process, and code can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kaqpFBzabcwdT5jzQgaR7Vjy3cY8yMEi_oeEL2pwMs4/edit?usp=sharing). \ \ \
